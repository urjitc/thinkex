## The Problem

AI needs context to think well, and humans need space to think well. Current tools split these functions: reasoning happens in chat logs, while information lives in scattered documents.

As a result, valuable reasoning gets buried in chat history. You find yourself explaining the same context repeatedly, and insights disappear into logs you never revisit.

ThinkEx solves this by making context explicit, structured, and persistent.

## What is ThinkEx?

Think of a large desk where you spread out textbooks, notes, and papers to study. You look back and forth, connecting dots and comparing sources.

ThinkEx is that desk, digitalized for the browser.

1.  **See Everything**: Bring PDFs, videos, and notes onto a visual canvas. Organize them spatially to make sense of the information.
2.  **Compare Sources**: Look across your sources side-by-side. Spot patterns and contradictions that only emerge when everything is visible.
3.  **Targeted Reasoning**: Select specific items on your desk for the AI to analyze. Point to a note and a paragraph and ask for the connection.
4.  **Capture Insights**: Extract findings into structured cards that become part of your permanent workspace.

## Features

*   **User-Controlled Context**: Manually select exact cards, notes, or document sections for the AI. No opaque retrieval mechanisms.
*   **Spatial Canvas**: Arrange notes, PDFs, videos, and chat side-by-side.
*   **First-Class Media**: Native PDF viewing with highlights; YouTube videos with transcript-backed context.
*   **Persistent Knowledge**: Saved cards (notes, flashcards, references) remain in your workspace.
*   **Multi-Model**: Switch AI models per task without locking into a single provider.
*   **Sharing**: Share or export workspaces with all context preserved.

## Why Existing Tools Fall Short

| Approach          | What It Does             | What It Loses                                     |
| :---------------- | :----------------------- | :------------------------------------------------ |
| **ThinkEx**       | **Integrated Reasoning** | --                                                |
| Chat-first tools  | Powerful reasoning       | Memory (context vanishes in logs)                 |
| Notes-first tools | Organization             | Reasoning (AI is not deeply integrated)           |
| RAG systems       | Auto-retrieval           | Control (you can't see/adjust selection)          |
| Long-context      | More tokens              | Understanding (coherence doesn't scale with size) |

## Self-Hosting

ThinkEx can be self hosted for local development. The setup uses Docker for PostgreSQL (recommended) while running the Next.js app locally for hot reload.

### Quick Start

#### Prerequisites

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v20+)
*   [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (will be installed automatically if missing)
*   [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (recommended for PostgreSQL) OR [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) (v12+) installed locally

#### Automated Setup

Run the interactive setup script:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ThinkEx-OSS/thinkex.git
cd thinkex
./setup.sh
```

The script will:
- Check prerequisites (Node.js, pnpm, Docker)
- Create `.env` file from template
- Generate `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` automatically
- Start PostgreSQL in Docker (or use local PostgreSQL if Docker is not available)
- Configure database connection
- Install dependencies
- Initialize the database schema

After setup, start the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Access ThinkEx at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

**PostgreSQL Docker Commands:**
- Stop PostgreSQL: `docker-compose down`
- Start PostgreSQL: `docker-compose up -d`
- View logs: `docker-compose logs -f postgres`

#### Manual Setup

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ThinkEx-OSS/thinkex.git
    cd thinkex
    ```

2.  **Start PostgreSQL (Docker)**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d postgres
    ```
    
    Or use your local PostgreSQL installation.

3.  **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

4.  **Configure environment variables**
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    
    Edit `.env` and configure:
    
    *   **Database**: Set `DATABASE_URL` to your PostgreSQL connection string
      ```bash
      # For Docker PostgreSQL:
      DATABASE_URL=postgresql://thinkex:thinkex_password_change_me@localhost:5432/thinkex
      
      # For local PostgreSQL:
      DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/thinkex
      ```
    *   **Better Auth**: Generate `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` with `openssl rand -base64 32`
    *   **Google OAuth**: Get credentials from [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
    *   **Supabase**: Your Supabase project URL and keys (for file storage, if using Supabase storage)
    *   **Google AI**: API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)

5.  **Initialize the database**
    ```bash
    pnpm db:push
    ```

6.  **Start the development server**
    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```

7.  **Access the application**
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

#### Storage Configuration

ThinkEx supports two storage backends for file uploads:

**Option 1: Local File Storage** (Recommended for Self-Hosting)
- Set `STORAGE_TYPE=local` in your `.env` file
- Files are stored in the `./uploads` directory
- No external dependencies required
- Simple setup with full control over your data

**Option 2: Supabase Storage** (Cloud-based)
- Set `STORAGE_TYPE=supabase` in your `.env` file
- Configure Supabase credentials:
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`: Your Supabase project URL
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_OR_ANON_KEY`: Anon key from Supabase
  - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`: Service role key from Supabase
- Create a storage bucket named `file-upload` and set it to **Public**
